Scikit-Learn has useful Gaussian Mixture for probabilities 
Be careful because they probably have two models: one for fitting
and another for generating samples.

Alternatively:
    3 components with different weights
        Flip a coin proportional to those weights 
        and draw a random sample from those individual 
        distributions. This works for just Gaussian mixtures
        
        Weighted sum of their CDFs. Then you can just pull from
        the CDF. If its less than the weight you draw from that sample
        
        N components of exponentials and Gaussians. 
        Normal variable, find out which weight range it falls into
        Then just draw a sample from the distribution that falls in line with
    
    https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributions.html?highlight=mixture#torch.distributions.mixture_same_family.MixtureSameFamily
    
    Package would roll the dice for you, give a number, and 
    draw the sample. Since we want to combine exponentials and normals,
    its better to build out from scratch but is still relatively simple
    
Initializing Timers:
    
    Semi-Markov Model
    Get a Stimulus Event 
        Assume that event is the mean of the distribution
        Update the mean with new samples 
    Then get another Stimulus and another Event
        Repeat from previous stimulus
    
    For new stimulus, calculate the likelihood of it belonging
    to each distribution and update the running average of the mean
    
    If its really off, create a new distribution
    Need some bias to avoid overfitting. Bias has 
    two components: one to keep track of distribution and 
    another to keep track of speed
    
    Default timer to capture new events and update to 
    record new events and probabilities 
    
    Keep track of variability to fit standard deviation
    
    First, choose a family
    
    Need to define and assign distribution families
    
    
    Dont want to record everything or else youll just overfit
    
    Neural networks currently tend to just learn every frame of video or all data
    instead of learning a timer interval to expect an event
    
    DDMs have good properties: they are speed adaptable through bias,
    can represent means and standard deviations with them.
    
    Model is:
        As soon as a stimulus occurs, I start multiple potential timers. When the event occurs,
        I store information about which ramp was closest. Or you could allocate 5 timers for each event
        and adjust their fan to represent the event's standard deviation
    
    Rivest will write down a basic rule to use
    Events A and B and their independent to get started
